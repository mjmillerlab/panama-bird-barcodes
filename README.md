## overview
Our goal was to sequence a 652 basepair fragment of the  COI mitochondrial gene from as many Panamanian breeding bird species across their national range as possible, given existing vouchered tissue samples, in order to provide baseline taxonomic, biogeographic, and phylogeographic data on Panamanian bird diversity.

##results
We sequenced a total of 2272 specimens representing 476 species of resident and migratory birds. However, we recovered 501 Barcode clusters (BINS), suggesting that as many as 25 avian lineages in Panama may represent cryptic species. Taking a closer look at our data we find that all cryptic cases involve Panamanian breeding land birds, of which we only surveyed 100 species comprehensively across the country. Furthermore, 24 of the 25 cases involve lowland, rather than highland, species, that geographically replace each other between eastern and western Panama . Our results suggest that Panamanian bird biodiversity may be under represented by 20%. Because there are no major geographic barriers separating the eastern and western lowlands in Panama, our study demonstrates the utility of this fauna for fundamental comparative studies in the dynamics of avian secondary contact and speciation.

We are working on the final manuscript for publication.

## collaborators
This project was conceived by Matthew Miller and Eldredge Bermingham, at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.

Maribel Gonzalez, Celestino Aguilar, Wayra Navia, Michael Levelvier did the bulk of the DNA sequencing.

Data analysis and manuscript preparation is being led by Matthew Miller, Daniel Buitrago-Rosas, and Justin Bernstein.

Matthew Miller and the STRI Bird Collection, [Kevin Winker](http://www.kevinwinker.org/) and the [University of Alaska Museum](http://www.universityofalaskamuseumbirds.org/), [John Klicka](http://klickalab.com/) and the [UW Burke Museum](http://www.burkemuseum.org/research-and-collections/ornithology), and [Robb Brumfield](http://www.museum.lsu.edu/brumfield.html) and the [LSU Museum of Natural Science](http://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/mns/) contributed vouchered tissue samples for the project.

Additionally, we took advantage of DNA barcode records from Panama that were published by the curatorial staff of the [Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History](http://vertebrates.si.edu/birds/).

## data
DNA sequence data as well as the meta-data (collecting location, voucher specimen details, etc.) are available on the BOLD barcoding of life portal at the project dataset: [DS-BSPUSNM](http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_SearchTerms?query=DS-BSPUSNM).

## funding
Funding for this project came from the [Smithsonian Consortium for the Barcode of Life](http://barcoding.si.edu/), as well as a grant to Matthew Miller from the NIH/NSF Fogarty International Center (Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Award 3R01-TW005869-05S1).
